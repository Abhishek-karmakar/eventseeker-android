	<h3>15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</h3>
	<p>
		A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic
		form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings
		based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject
		to the same conditions as other business documents and records
		originally generated and maintained in printed form. You and Company
		agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the
		Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action
		arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.<br />
		These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
		laws of the state of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules,
		and the United States of America. Any dispute arising from or relating
		to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by
		arbitration in San Francisco County, California, using the English
		language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of
		Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;)
		then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial
		experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract
		disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS
		arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of
		JAMS. The prevailing party in the arbitration shall be entitled to
		receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable
		attorneys&rsquo; fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses)
		incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered
		may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be
		made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order
		of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
		each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of
		proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a
		final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement,
		the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United
		States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.
		Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not
		give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including without
		limitation, this section.

		illegal. If you access the Service from other locations, you do so at
		your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local
		laws.<br />

	<h3>17. MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>
	<p>Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its
		obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond
		Company&rsquo;s reasonable control, including, without limitation,
		mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation

		electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or

		of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any
		failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure
		results from any cause beyond Company&rsquo;s reasonable control,
		including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or
		communications failure or degradation. If any provision of this
		Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision
		shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that
		this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and
		enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or
		sublicensable by User except with Company&rsquo;s prior written
		consent. Company may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and
		its rights and obligations without consent. This Agreement shall be
		governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of
		California without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
		Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive
		statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes

		and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this
		Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by
		both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency,
		partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of
		this Agreement and User does not have any authority of any kind to
		bind Company in any respect whatsoever.</p>
